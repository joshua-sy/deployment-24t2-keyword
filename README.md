## WHAT IS KEYWORD?
KEYWORD is a web application which uses socket.io to allow the joining and hosting of rooms, where users can gather and play a mafia-like game.

## RULES OF THE GAME
Every user is given a word correlating to the category chosen, they are a SCIENTIST. However, among one of the 
scientists is a CYBORG, they do NOT know the word. Everybody take turns saying something that relates to the word given.
The goal of the scientist is to figure out who the cyborg is and the goal of the cyborg is to blend in with the crowd.
After the timer runs out, the players will choose who the cyborg is, if the cyborg is chosen, they get one chance to win by
guessing what the word given is, so be specific but not too specific as to not let the cyborg guess the word and be generic but
not too generic as to not get chosen as the cyborg! Have fun!
